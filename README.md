# Smart-Calculator-JetBrains

Smart Calculator is a graduate project for track Kotlin Basics.
Graduate projects contain core topics for this track. You need to apply core topics in project stages to verify your knowledge. At least one graduate project is required to complete the track.
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.
